TO FIX:

*automatically set this
IF status = 'pending' and CURRENT_DATE() > date_of_appointment THEN set status to 'rejected'
IF status = 'approved' and CURRENT_DATE() > date_of_appointment THEN set status to 'done'

*gray-container is not expanding, rows is extending outside the div

*text appearing in the navbar 'None' depending on the number of unread notification
